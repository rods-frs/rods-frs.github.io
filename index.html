        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <h3>User interfaces</h3>
        <p>The OS itself is just the terminal, what makes the interface that we interact with is what we call UI's, and for linux there's a bunch of good options to use, i'll talk about the 3 biggest ones</p>
        <h4>Gnome</h4>

        <p>GNOME is a simple and modern desktop interface for Linux that helps you interact with your computer visually, like using windows, icons, and menus instead of typing commands. It includes tools like a file manager to browse your files, a settings app to adjust things like Wi-Fi or display, and a clean workspace where you can open and switch between apps easily. GNOME focuses on being easy to use, with a minimalist design and smooth animations, and you can customize it with extensions if you want more features. It’s used in popular Linux systems like Ubuntu and Fedora, and it supports newer technologies like Wayland for better performance.</p>
        <h4>KDE</h4>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>KDE is another desktop interface for Linux that’s known for being highly customizable and visually rich. It gives you a full graphical environment with windows, menus, and icons, and includes built-in apps like a file manager, system settings, and a software center. Unlike GNOME, KDE lets you tweak almost everything—from how things look to how they behave—so you can make your desktop truly yours. It’s fast, efficient, and packed with features, but still easy to use. KDE is used in Linux systems like Kubuntu and Fedora KDE, and it runs on a display system called Wayland or the older X11.</p>
        <h4>Cinnamon</h4>
        <figure>

        <p>Cinnamon is a Linux desktop interface that looks and feels more like traditional Windows, making it easy for new users to get comfortable. It gives you a taskbar, start menu, and system tray, along with tools to manage files, settings, and apps. Cinnamon is designed to be simple and familiar, but still lets you customize things like themes and panel layout. It’s smooth and lightweight, and works well even on older computers. You’ll often find Cinnamon in Linux Mint, which is one of the most beginner-friendly Linux distributions.</p>
